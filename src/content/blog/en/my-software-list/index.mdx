## 0x0 Prologue

Since my first encounter with computers back in middle school, my software preferences have shifted like the seasons.

I used to be a "tool chaser," obsessed with hunting down every new "god-tier" app. Whether it solved a tiny niche problem or just had a stunning UI, I had to try it. Back then, my 50 Mbps connection felt painfully slow—waiting minutes for a download while my heart raced in anticipation...

But as time passed and the novelty faded, I realized that only a handful of tools actually stuck. These are the ones I open daily, the ones that feel like an extension of my hands, the ones ingrained in my **muscle memory**.

This isn't a technical spec sheet or a feature-by-feature comparison. It’s a highly personal **"Survivor’s List."** I don't care if they are the trendiest or the newest; I only care if they "get" me. Here is my digital arsenal.

> This is a living document that I update periodically. If you have any "hidden gems," feel free to share them in the comments!

## 0x1 AI & The Second Brain

* **[Gemini Pro](https://gemini.google.com/):** My current go-to LLM. In my experience, it outperforms ChatGPT in context retention. It actually remembers nuances from conversations a month or two ago—a feature that genuinely blew me away.
* **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/):** More than just a Markdown editor; it’s the foundation of my knowledge base. Its greatest strength lies in its plugin ecosystem—if you can dream of a feature, there’s probably a plugin for it.
* **[PDFgear](https://www.pdfgear.com/):** A recent find. It’s a free PDF editor that allows direct text editing. It offers features for free that Foxit or Adobe charge a premium for.
* **[Doubao](https://www.doubao.com/chat/):** A domestic AI model. While it might not match Gemini’s raw power, it’s incredibly convenient and versatile for quick tasks.
* **[Cubox](https://cubox.cc/):** My "Read-it-Later" command center. It clips articles directly from the browser. The **offline reading** mode is a lifesaver for focused reading when the internet is out of reach. 
* **[Typora](https://typora.io/):** While Obsidian is powerful, I still turn to Typora for long-form writing. Its "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) interface is unmatched—zero distractions, just the smooth flow of words.

## 0x2 Dev & Build

* **[Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/):** Google’s AI-native IDE. It supports Gemini and Claude with seamless Git integration. It’s essentially a supercharged VS Code, and with a Gemini Pro quota, I never run out of "tokens."
* **[Antigravity Tool](https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager):** An open-source manager for Antigravity. It handles account management and proxies, which is essential for logging in if you're behind a strict firewall.
* **[Notepad4](https://github.com/zufuliu/notepad4):** A lightweight "upgrade" to Notepad2. It’s my default Windows Notepad replacement—fast, clean, and supports syntax highlighting for almost every language.

## 0x3 The Studio

* **[Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/):** Paired with a Pixel, I get unlimited original-quality backups. I use **Sync** to move photos from my iPhone (preserving dates and Live Photos). The recent Gemini-powered search makes finding specific memories effortless.
* **[Sync (Resilio)](https://www.resilio.com/sync/):** A cross-platform file synchronization tool. It uses LAN-based incremental syncing, which solved my long-standing headache of messy metadata when moving photos between iPhone and Android.
* **[Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html):** The gold standard for photo editing. From HDR processing to batch-pasting edits, it’s the tool that turned my photography hobby into something worth sharing.

## 0x4 System & Efficiency

* **[Snipaste](https://www.snipaste.com/index.html):** I’ve used this for years. The **"Pin to Screen"** feature is addictive—once you start using it to reference info while working, you can never go back.
* **[Uninstall Tool](https://crystalidea.com/uninstall-tool):** My preferred Windows uninstaller. It’s fast and searchable, but the real highlight is its ability to **wipe registry leftovers** after a program is gone. A must-have for the "digital minimalists."
* **[Twinkle Tray](https://twinkletray.com/):** Controls monitor brightness via software. It supports DDC/CI, allowing me to adjust settings or even turn off my monitors with a simple mouse shortcut.
* **[Shandianshuo (闪电说)](https://shandianshuo.cn/):** An AI-powered voice input tool. It converts speech to text with incredible accuracy, making it significantly faster than manual typing for brainstorming or drafting.

## 0x5 Browser Power-ups

* **[Tampermonkey (Beta)](http://tampermonkey.net/):** The ultimate "cheat engine" for the web. It gives me total control over how websites behave—whether it's bypassing copy restrictions or adding custom features to a clunky dashboard.
* **[AutoVerify](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/autoverify/jgcfgcdociopaedpeiacalnccfiaeeej):** Automatically handles simple CAPTCHAs. It’s one of those "silent" tools that gives you a tiny hit of dopamine every time it saves you a few seconds.
* **[ChatGPT Conversation Timeline](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-conversation-time/ickndngbbabdllekmflaaogkpmnloalg):** Adds a timeline to the AI chat interface. No more endless scrolling; just hover to preview and click to jump.
* **[Immersive Translate](https://immersivetranslate.com/):** One-click bilingual translation for web pages and even YouTube subtitles. The dev is incredibly active and responsive.
* **[AdBlock](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom):** It’s been so long I’ve lost count of how many ads it has blocked. The best plugin is the one you forget is even there.

## 0x6 Entertainment & Gaming

* **[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/):** Needs no introduction. The undisputed #1 platform for buying and managing games.
* **Epic Games:** I’m mostly here for the weekly "freebies." I’ve snagged everything from GTA V to the Batman Trilogy without spending a dime.

Software tools are like friends. I used to chase the flashy and the new, but now I value the "trusted allies" that understand how I work. Some we’ve known for years; others are new faces that I’m sure will become staples of my routine.

Ultimately, tools should serve the person. The "best" app is simply the one that works for you.

**What are your "can't-delete" treasures?** Or perhaps a niche tool that solved a massive headache? I’d love to hear about your "trusted allies" in the comments—it might just be the next addition to my list!
